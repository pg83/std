# C++ style

This project follows the house style used by `libstd`. Readability and a
stable, unsurprising shape are more important than saving vertical space.
`.clang-format` encodes the mechanical subset; the naming, organization and
constructor rules below remain part of review.

## Names

- Types, enum values and test names use `UpperCamelCase`.
- Functions, methods, variables and parameters use `lowerCamelCase`.
- Private data members use `lowerCamelCase_` with a trailing underscore.
- Compile-time constants use `lowerCamelCase` unless they are C-style ABI
  constants or macros.
- Macros use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` and project-owned macros use a `SHITTY_`
  prefix. Names required by a system header or protocol retain their external
  spelling.
- Acronyms are words inside an identifier: `HttpClient`, `IoReactor`,
  `utf8Decoder`, not `HTTPClient`, `IOReactor` or `utf8_decoder`.
- Source filenames are lowercase `snake_case`. Every `.h` has a corresponding
  `.cpp`, even when that translation unit only includes the header to verify
  that the header compiles on its own.

Do not encode scope or type in a name. Prefer a precise noun or verb over a
prefix such as `m_`, `p_`, `str_` or `is_`.

## Braces and indentation

- Use four spaces. Tabs are forbidden.
- Indent the contents of every namespace, including an anonymous namespace,
  by one level. The namespace declaration itself remains at its enclosing
  scope.
- Opening braces are attached for namespaces, types, functions, lambdas and
  control flow. `else`, `catch` and `while` in a `do` statement stay on the
  same line as the preceding closing brace.
- Every braced body spans multiple lines. Do not write one-line functions,
  control statements, types or namespaces.
- Braces are required for every `if`, `else`, loop and `switch` arm body, even
  when the body is one statement.
- `case` labels are indented one level inside their `switch`.
- Preprocessor directives nested under a conditional are indented before the
  `#`.

```cpp
struct Example: public Interface {
    void run() override {
        if (ready) {
            consume();
        }
    }
};
```

Shitty is a program, not a library. Do not wrap its code in a project namespace.
Use anonymous namespaces for translation-unit-local declarations, indent their
contents, and do not add comments to namespace-closing braces.

## Constructors

Constructors are the deliberate exception to the attached-brace rule. Put the
initializer list on separate lines, put `:` before the first initializer and a
leading comma before every following initializer, then put the body brace on
its own line:

```cpp
Widget::Widget(int width, int height)
    : width_(width)
    , height_(height)
{
}
```

Use the same shape for delegating constructors and in-class definitions. Do
not omit the empty body and do not put `{` after the last initializer.

Clang-format 21 cannot express a brace break for constructors without also
breaking every ordinary function. `style.py` therefore runs clang-format and
then restores this one brace with a bracket-aware second pass. Use the script,
not clang-format directly.

## Spacing and declarations

- Do not put a space between a function name and `(`. Put one after control
  keywords: `call(arg)`, `if (condition)`.
- Attach `*` and `&` to the type: `const Cell* cell`, `Frame& frame`.
- Attach an inheritance colon to the class name and always state the access:
  `class Frame: public Base`, never `class Frame : Base`.
- Put spaces around binary and assignment operators and after commas. Do not
  put spaces just inside parentheses, brackets or template angle brackets.
- Keep a declaration's type and function name on the same line.
- Keep each statement and expression on one physical line. Do not continue
  conditions, operators, stream expressions or assignments on later lines.
- A function call or declaration is the only construct that may be split. If
  it is split, put every argument or parameter on its own indented line and
  put the closing parenthesis on its own line:

```cpp
functionCall(
    first,
    second,
    third
);
```

- Write one statement per line.
- Separate consecutive function and method definitions with one empty line.
- Prefer the fixed-width aliases from `<cstdint>` where representation matters.

## Functions and headers

- Keep every non-template function longer than one trivial statement out of
  headers. Headers describe interfaces; implementation belongs in the paired
  `.cpp` file. Templates are the only exception.
- Do not use `.icc` files. Put non-template definitions in the paired `.cpp`
  and keep template definitions in the header that declares them.
- A class declared in a `.cpp` file contains declarations only. Define every
  method out of line, including constructors, destructors and trivial accessors.
  If the class is declared in an anonymous namespace, close that namespace
  before its qualified method definitions.
- Avoid heavyweight includes in headers when a forward declaration suffices.
- Includes go from the least general to the most general, one blank line
  between groups: the paired header first, then project headers, then
  `<std/...>`, then third-party and system headers. Within a group, shorter
  paths come first. `style.py` rewrites the leading include block into this
  order; includes behind preprocessor conditionals stay where they are.
- File-local declarations belong in an anonymous namespace. Shared program
  declarations live in the global namespace.
- Avoid non-trivial global objects. Make ownership and lifetime explicit.

## Errors and client input

- `STD_VERIFY` and `VK_CHECK` throw, and the only catch is around the whole
  event loop: a failure there ends the session. Use them for our own
  invariants only — startup, compositor-sized resources, state we created.
- An allocation or GPU object sized by client input never goes through a
  throwing macro. Check the result in place and degrade: cap the size before
  allocating, skip the content with a log line, or disconnect the offending
  client (`wl_client_post_no_memory`). A client must not be able to reach the
  top-level catch.

## Comments and formatting

- Comments explain invariants, intent or a non-obvious constraint; they do not
  narrate the next line.
- Keep comments grammatical and current. Do not reflow carefully arranged
  comments or protocol tables merely to fit a column limit.
- There is no practical column limit. The large mechanical limit in
  `.clang-format` exists to collapse accidental statement wrapping; it is not
  a target line length.
- Keep at most one empty line between logical blocks and no empty line at the
  start of a block.

Run `./style.py` to format all tracked C++ sources. Set `CLANG_FORMAT` when the
binary is not named `clang-format` on `PATH`. Generated files and
`render.comp` are intentionally excluded.
